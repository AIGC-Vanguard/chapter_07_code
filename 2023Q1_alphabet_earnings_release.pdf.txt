Alphabet Announces First Quarter 2023 Results
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – April 25, 2023 – Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) today announced financial
results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “We are pleased with our business performance in the first
quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored
in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see
huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation.”
Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Resilience in Search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1
consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion, up 3% year over year, or up 6% in constant currency. We remain committed
to delivering long-term growth and creating capacity to invest in our most compelling growth areas by re-engineering
our cost base.”
Q1 2023 financial highlights (unaudited)
Our first quarter 2023 results reflect:
i. $2.6 billion in charges related to reductions in our workforce and office space;
ii. a $988 million reduction in depreciation expense from the change in estimated useful life of our servers and
certain network equipment; and
iii. a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards resulting in relatively less
stock-based compensation expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining quarters of
the year. The shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the
full fiscal year 2023.
For further information, please refer to our blog post also filed with the SEC via Form 8-K on April 20, 2023.

Segment Operating Results
Reflecting DeepMind’s increasing collaboration with Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in
the first quarter of 2023 DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet’s unallocated corporate costs instead of within
Other Bets. Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated and simplified our cost allocation
methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. Prior periods have
been recast to reflect the revised presentation and are shown in Recast Historical Segment Results below.
As announced on April 20, 2023, we are bringing together part of Google Research (the Brain Team) and DeepMind
to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. This change does not affect first quarter reporting. The group, called
Google DeepMind, will be reported within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs beginning in the second quarter of
2023.

corporate costs include charges related to the reductions in our workforce and office space totaling $2.5 billion.

Additional information relating to the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (unaudited)
Reductions in Our Workforce and Office Space
In January 2023, we announced a reduction of our workforce, and as a result in the first quarter of 2023 we
recorded employee severance and related charges of $2.0 billion, representing the majority of expected costs
associated with this action. In addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space, and as a result we
recorded charges related to office space reductions of $564 million in the first quarter of 2023. We may incur
additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.
These severance and office space charges are included within our consolidated statements of income for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 as follows (in millions):
Severance and
Related Office Space Total
Cost of revenues $ 461 $ 220 $ 681
Research and development 835 247 1,082
Sales and marketing 445 35 480
General and administrative 253 62 315
Total charges $ 1,994 $ 564 $ 2,558
For segment reporting, the substantial majority of these charges are included within unallocated corporate costs in
our segment results.
Change in Useful Lives of Our Server and Network Equipment
In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and
adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain
network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal
year 2023 and the effect for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a reduction in depreciation expense of
$988 million and an increase in net income of $770 million, or $0.06 per basic and $0.06 per diluted share.
Timing of Our Annual Employee Equity Grants
Beginning in 2023, the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards shifted from January to
March. While the shift in timing itself will not affect the amount of stock-based compensation expense over the full
fiscal year 2023, it results in relatively less expense recognized in the first quarter compared to the remaining
quarters of the year.
Stock Repurchases
On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional
$70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its
stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading
prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to
time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans.
